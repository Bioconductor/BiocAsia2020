The conference will feature a poster session and a number of selected short talks (15mins), lightning talks (5mins) and workshops (55 mins). To be considered for such a presentation, please fill out the [application form](https://mccb.umassmed.edu/BiocAsia2020/) by 25th September 2020.

## F1000Research

We are delighted to announce that all posters and slides from the conference this year will be hosted on the F1000Research [Bioconductor Gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/bioconductor/about-this-gateway) with the "BiocAsia2020" area. Once accepted, a follow-up email will be sent out to authors with instructions to submit their poster or talk slides to F1000Research. 

The submission is free of charge, and published posters on F1000Research will receive a digital object identifier (DOI). This is a great opportunity to get credit for your work and increase its visibility and impact. There are no formatting requirements for posters (feel free to be creative); however, for those who would like to use it, a [poster template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N3pDnixeVwRFrjQrSJL9eziXq4RpcfaT/view) is available. Inclusion of the Bioconductor logo and/or #BioCAsia2020 is encouraged.

We also encourage conference attendees to contribute articles on Bioconductor workflows or packages to the Bioconductor gateway on F1000Research (Article Processing Charges apply).
