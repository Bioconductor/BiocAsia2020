## Registration

Register at [our event page](https://biocasia2020.eventbrite.com.au).
The registration fee includes access to the virtual platform for the conference, talks, workshops, Q&As following each session, and networking opportunities.
This fee helps us cover the cost of the platform and other associated costs for the conference. 

If you are currently experiencing financial hardship or reduced funding, please apply for a [BioC Asia 2020 Scholarship](./scholarships.md) for a waiver on the registration fee.

## Cancellation Policy

Bioconductor is a non-profit organization, and conferences are designed only to break even every year.
As a result we are generally unable to offer individual refunds.
